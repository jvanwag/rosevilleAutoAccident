    Many people don’t realize how severe an auto accident can be. However, much research shows that the aftermath of an automobile accident can leave your body in tremendously bad shape that many think is impossible to recover from. As a Roseville Chiropractor, I have noticed that many people are misinformed when it comes to whiplash. I hope this article will help better explain whiplash, why it happens, and how Roseville Auto Accident Injury Chiropractic can help.

</br>
I want to address a very common question: what happens to your body that causes a whiplash injury to occur? Whiplash can happen whenever your body suffers from an abrupt jolt. Most whiplash injuries happen when you are sitting in a fixed position in your car and are rear-ended by another car. Because this happens so fast, your body doesn’t have time to react before your car is pushed forward. During those moments of impact, your body gets pushed down into your seat. Your head, which is heavy and secluded by your neck, is delayed in reaction, while your body is continually pushed down. Quickly after, your head changes directions by traveling forward to the limit your seatbelt will allow. Finally, once your head reaches the limit traveling forward, it is forced backwards in reaction. Because your neck is not restricted by your seatbelt, your head is jolted back and forth beyond its standard limits. When this “whipping” action occurs, it causes much damage to the already extremely fragile neck structure.

What a lot of people don’t realize is that it can take multiple days (usually around two or three) before any whiplash symptoms occur. Common whiplash symptoms include headaches, neck pain, and loss of motion. The reason it can take a few days to feel the symptoms is because it can take time for the inflammation from the tiny tears in the injured ligaments and muscles to build up and further aggravate you. When the delicate ligaments that support your neck are wounded, the muscles react by tightening to guard the injured area. This protects the damaged area from further injury.

A few weeks following this injury, the distressed tissue releases chemicals that attach little cells to the wounded area, called Fibroblasts. They build up, creating a scar-like material called fibrin. Fibrin then helps mend and re-build the injury. During these few weeks of repair, it is extremely important to maintain normal ranges of motion, as well as spinal alignment. If this is not done properly, the scar tissue will end up limiting the future mobility of the injured area. This can lead to spinal degeneration.
